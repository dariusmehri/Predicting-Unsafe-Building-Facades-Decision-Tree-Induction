#Research Question and Data

###Can the DOB develop a model using existing to predict unsafe buildings? Are building characteristics a good predictor to determine whether a building facade is safe or unsafe?

###Data: Compliance database

Owners who own buildings greater than 6 floors are required to file whether their building facade is safe or unsafe.

Currently the most useful data because large and has low sampling bias,  owners are required by law file a report to the DOB.

Dataset included filings from 2000 through the present.

Data limitations â€“ Compliance only applies to buildings 6 floors or higher

#Model

###Decision tree induction

Decision tree models are  classifiers that utilize a tree structure to model the relationships among the features and the potential outcomes.

Trained model, calculated accuracy and applied rules to test data.

Dependent variable: Building is "unsafe" or "safe"

Independent variables: Building frontage (the width of the building), age, assess total value of the bilding, number of floors, type of ownership (public or private), prevoius complaint history.
