#Research Question and Data

###Can the DOB develop a model to predict unsafe buildings?

###Data: Compliance database

Owners who own buildings greater than 6 floors are required to file whether their building facade is safe or unsafe.

Current the most useful data because large and low sampling bias,  owners are required by law  file a report to the DOB

Data limitations â€“ Compliance only applies to buildings 6 floors or higher
